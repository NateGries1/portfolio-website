                    Currently creating a problem-solving website using next.js and firebase to allow users to choose a challenging problem from our database, write their code in our text editor, run their code, and get tailored hints through our AI Hint Bot. This project will be a prime problem-solving platform for users to hone coding skills and practice their technical programming.
